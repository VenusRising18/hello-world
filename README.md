# hello-world
my first repository

My name is Darby, I'm currently in the process of teaching myself how to code. I'd like to one day be very fluent in it and then make a career of it. Web design is really the only experience I have. HTML5 and CSS3 have been what I've been practicing the most since beginning this journey.
